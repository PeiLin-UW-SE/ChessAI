# ChessAI
Chess AI in C++ using minimax with alpha-beta pruning

To Play:

- A move command is given as a string of 4 characters
- To create a move command concatenate the `coordinates` of where the piece starts and where it ends
	- For example, the command `e2e4` will move the King's Pawn 2 spaces forwards
- The AI will respond accordingly
- If at any time you wish to quit, simply type `q` in-place of a move command
