# ChessAI
Chess AI in C++ using minimax with alpha-beta pruning

To Play:
	> A move command is given as a string of 4 characters
	> To create a move command concatenate the `coordinates` of where the piece starts and where it ends
		> For example, `e2e4` to move the King's Pawn 2 spaces forwards
    > The AI will respond accordingly
    > If at any time you wish to quit, simply input `q` in-place of a move command
